ARCore Raw Depth API Codelab
============================
Copyright 2021 Google LLC.  All rights reserved.

This Codelab provides examples for how developers can use the Raw Depth API in ARCore to expand the 3D geometric sensing of their AR applications.

Please visit the [codelab instructions](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/arcore-rawdepthapi).

This codelab provides step-by-step instructions for how to use raw depth for the following use-cases:
 * 3D Pointcloud filtering:  Create 3D pointclouds from raw depth images, and preserving the highest-confidence geometry.
 * Object-of-interest detection: Simple geometric analysis of depth to detect objects of interest in the scene.

## Android Studio projects

This codelab contains the following projects:
 * `part0_work`: The starting project with no functionality.  You should write code here.
 * `part1`: Reference code when you complete Part 1 (retrieving raw depth data).
 * `part2`: Reference code when you complete Part 2 (visualizing raw depth pointclouds).
 * `part3_completed`: The completed project with all the functionality of this codelab.
